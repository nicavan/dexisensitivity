\title{Calculate Node Weight List}
\usage{
determine_weight_list(node_path, main_tree, is_leaf, aggregation, children)
}
\arguments{
\item{node_path}{\code{character} vector indicating the node's path.}

\item{main_tree}{Object containing the XML tree structure data.}

\item{is_leaf}{\code{logical} flag denoting if the node is a leaf.}

\item{aggregation}{Aggregation structure for potential weight determination.}

\item{children}{\code{list} of node's children.}
}
\value{
\code{numeric} vector of the node's associated weights.
}
\description{
Computes weights for a node based on its attributes and conditions, such as
its leaf status and child count. Weights can indicate probabilities or
significance within the tree.
