\title{Evaluate Order of Tree Nodes}
\usage{
evaluate_order(tree)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{a \code{Tree} object.}
}
\value{
A \code{numeric} vector indicating the order in which the nodes
should be evaluated. An empty vector suggests no specific order.
}
\description{
Determines the sequential order in which nodes within a tree should be
evaluated. This is particularly pertinent for trees with aggregated leaves,
where the evaluation order of the nodes impacts the final outcomes.
}
\details{
The function first checks if the tree has aggregated leaves. If not,
it returns an empty vector since there is no explicit order needed.

If there are aggregated leaves, the function sets an initial state
assuming none of the attributes are evaluated. It then marks the
tree's leaves as evaluated.

The main logic revolves around iterating over leaf nodes and evaluating
them. However, if a node depends on another node, it is skipped and
re-evaluated in subsequent iterations. The function also contains a
safeguard against infinite loops by checking if the same nodes are
continually skipped across consecutive iterations.
