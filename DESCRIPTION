Description: Provides a versatile toolkit for analyzing and visualizing 'DEXi' 
    (Decision EXpert for education) decision trees, facilitating multi-criteria
    decision analysis directly within R. Users can read .dxi files, manipulate
    decision trees, and evaluate various scenarios. It supports sensitivity
    analysis through Monte Carlo simulations, one-at-a-time approaches, and
    variance-based methods, helping to discern the impact of input variations.
    Additionally, it includes functionalities for generating sampling plans and
    an array of visualization options for decision trees and analysis results. 
    A distinctive feature is the synoptic table plot, aiding in the efficient
    comparison of scenarios. Whether for in-depth decision modeling or 
    sensitivity analysis, this package stands as a comprehensive solution.
